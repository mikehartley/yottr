Tech:
    Add new fields from review.

    Check that text doesn't lead to injection attacks, if so use some kind of encoder.

    Look at Ansible for automated deployment and configuration management.

    Support for pictures.
    List of all UK marinas.

    Email based link for authentication for:
        sign-up,
        password reset.

    UI acceptance testing using Selenium.
    Swear filter.
    Check field validations (and verify lengths are suitable for strings).

UI:
    Fix bootstrap column issues (must add to 12) (done: signup, list all boats, list all users)
    Search panel uses a table - convert to bootstrap

User:
*    Search for listings by reference/date posted/date relevant to/length/qualification/sailing purpose.
    Saved searches.
    Favourites / watch list.
    Send message to admin (might be covered by having an email account).

Long term:
    Ability to register as part of a boat's crew (favourites?). Then you could see things relevant for that boat
        such as upcoming trips, previous trips.
    A booking system for voyages?
    Sailing log. Could have a log for a boat, then you could select a trip it's been on instead of 
        having to write an entry from scratch.
    Android and iOS app.
    Internal messaging.
    Email when search hit found.
    Twitter feeds.
    Commercial adverts.
    Resale channel.
    Google Maps for results.
    Email posters after a set period of inactivity to confirm that advert is still relevant.
    Crew profiles so that owners and organisations can search for crew directly.
